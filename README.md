Our product/project aspires to create job review tool that allows both managers and workers to review themselves or others, for increased understanding and transparency in the performance review process.

We envisioned a repository of Employees, Job Titles, and Skills.  Connecting them all together in a coherent fashion while allowing for appropriate edits would be our challenge.

The Minimum Viable Product after two weeks of work sets up Logins, Adding of Employees, Deleting of Employees, Connecting Employees to a Job Title (Role), Adding of Roles, Adding of Skills, Connecting skills to Roles, and displaying sets of skills associated with a Particular Employee.

Much more can be added to this demonstration of basic functionality.  Much needs to be added to this demonstration to make it a complete product.
